# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Social Rules

We follow a set of lightweight social rules designed to create a supportive, productive, and welcoming environment for all contributors.

### No Feigning Surprise

Don't act surprised when someone doesn't know something. This applies to both technical things (*"What?! I can't believe you don't know what goroutines are!"*) and non-technical things (*"You've never heard of that library?!"*).

Feigning surprise makes people feel bad for not knowing something and less likely to ask questions or contribute.

### No Well-Actually's

A "well-actually" happens when someone says something that's almost—but not entirely—correct, and you interject with a minor correction that doesn't add value to the discussion.

Before correcting someone, consider: Is this relevant? Does it help solve the problem?

### No Back-Seat Driving

If you see people working through a problem in an issue or pull request, don't jump in with unsolicited advice unless you're actively participating in the conversation.

If you want to help, ask first or open a new issue with your suggestion.

### No Subtle -isms

This rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. These are small things that make others feel unwelcome—things we all sometimes do by mistake.

If someone points this out, simply apologize, reflect, and move on.

## Handling Mistakes

When you notice a social rule violation:
- Point it out kindly and briefly
- Assume good intent
- Move on

When someone points out your mistake:
- Apologize briefly
- Reflect on how to avoid it
- Move on—don't over-apologize

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

It also applies when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Consequences

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

1. A warning with clarification of expected behavior
2. Temporary ban from project spaces
3. Permanent ban from project spaces

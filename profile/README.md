# Go Serves

**Production-ready server foundations for Go.**

Welcome to **Go Serves**. We provide a "beaten path" for building robust network services in Go. Whether you are building high-performance microservices, real-time streaming platforms, or restricted IoT node communication, we provide the architectural spine so you can focus on the implementation logic.

## 📖 About

In the modern backend landscape, spinning up a quickserver is easy, but building a *production-grade* server is hard. There are many "undercurrents" required to support a functional application: graceful shutdowns, connection pooling, security wrappers, and observability to name a few.

**Go Serves** is a collection of "batteries included" frameworks and boilerplates. We don't just give you a server; we give you a secure, observable, and resilient foundation with sensible defaults pre-configured.

### Our Philosophy: A Beaten Path
We believe in opinionated software that works out of the box. Our projects provide the scaffolding for the specific server types listed below, ensuring that the "Key Characteristics" of every protocol are respected and optimized.

### Scope of Projects
Our organization maintains projects across four primary domains, derived from the core layers of modern networking:

#### 1. API Architecture
*Standardized interfaces for public and internal communication.*
*   **RESTful:** Resource-based, stateless architectures tailored for public APIs.
*   **gRPC:** High-performance, strictly typed binary communication using Protocol Buffers for internal microservices.

## 🙋 Getting Help

Whether you are a public user implementing our libraries or a member of the organization maintaining them, here is how to engage with us:

### For Public Users
*   **Documentation:** Every project includes a `examples/` folder with a "Quick Start" guide demonstrating our default configurations.
*   **Issues:** If you encounter a unexpected behavior or missing functionality (a feature you expect to be standard), please open an Issue in the specific project.
